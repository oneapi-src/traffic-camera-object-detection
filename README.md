# **Traffic Camera Object Detection using PyTorch**

## Introduction
Traffic management is an important issue plaguing well-established and rapidly growing cities. Due to bad traffic management and accidents, there is a huge loss in productivity as people spend a lot of additional time on roads navigating traffic, which impacts performance at work and overall quality of life. Traffic accidents are dangerous and often result in fatalities. The time taken to respond to accidents and send medical aid depends on multiple human factors. Often a lack of timely response impacts the likelihood of survival.

 <!-- Purpose -->
## Purpose

Intelligent traffic management systems leveraging video surveillance, automated accident detection, and prediction solutions will go a long way in improving safety and traffic flow in cities. These solutions need to provide real-time insights and recommendations to be effective.
Cloud, Edge Computing, 5G, Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies form the core technology stack of intelligent traffic management systems. IP Cameras and Cloud-based communication between devices although effective solutions for traffic management, would introduce additional latency and bandwidth issues which could be detrimental in traffic management scenarios.

Leveraging the power of edge computing, communication between devices with very low latency can be achieved. A few example scenarios include traffic signals and vehicles exchanging information about pedestrians on crosswalks, communication between surveillance cameras and vehicles regarding proximity, and the possibility of an accident with very low latency; thus enabling preventive action in near real-time.
Deep Learning (DL) algorithms can predict traffic accidents based on live traffic camera feeds. Computer vision tasks and complex feature analysis can be accomplished easily with high performance by leveraging Deep Learning algorithms.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) based detection algorithms deployed at the edge enable real-time analytics of video feeds and detection of accidents and other issues, thus improving overall traffic management.

## Reference Solution

- AI-enabled traffic camera imaging aid helps address traffic management challenges by reducing congestion on road, improving the accuracy of pedestrian/vehicle identification, improving device-2-device communication, and helping reduce accidents.
- In this reference kit, we have created a general detection model that is capable of distinguishing objects that would be relevant to traffic cameras. We first preprocess a Pascal VOC dataset by combining it with COCO classes using OpenCV. We then perform a transfer learning approach using an advanced pre-trained real-time object detection YOLOv5 model, which is further trained to detect vehicles and pedestrians. After that, OpenCV and NumPy based postprocessing of Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) and centroid-based distance calculation of detected objects is used to predict a possible collision, which could be used for example to warn vehicle drivers via device-2-device communication.
- Since GPUs are typically the choice for Deep Learning and AI processing to achieve a higher Frames Per Second (FPS) rate, to offer a more cost-effective option leveraging a CPU, we use the quantization technique, leveraging Intel Analytics toolkit, to achieve high FPS by performing vectorized operations on CPUs itself.
- By quantizing/compressing the model (from floating point to integer model), while maintaining a similar level of accuracy as the floating point model, we demonstrate efficient utilization of underlying resources when deployed on edge devices with low processing and memory capabilities.

## **Key Implementation Details**
- Highlighted the performance gain provided by Intel® Extension for PyTorch* v1.13.0 over the stock version of the PyTorch v1.13.0.<br>
- The dataset is first preprocessed using OpenCV and NumPy, and then NumPy based postprocessing is performed using Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) and centroid-based distance calculations for possible collision detection.
- CNN-based YOLOV5 object detection model is a promising method to identify objects from the traffic camera. The time required for inference and the accuracy of the model are captured for multiple runs on the stock version as well on the Intel® oneAPI version. The average of these runs is considered and the comparison has been provided.
- Model has been quantized using Intel® Neural Compressor and Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ which has shown high-performance vectorized operations on Intel® platforms.

#### 5. **Using Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™**
When it comes to the deployment of this model on Edge devices, with less computing and memory resources, we further need to explore 
options for quantizing and compressing the model which brings out the same level of accuracy and efficient utilization of underlying 
computing resources. Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit facilitates the optimization of a deep learning model from a framework 
and deployment using an inference engine on such computing platforms based on Intel hardware accelerators. This section covers the steps 
to use this toolkit for model quantization and measure its performance.

#### Model conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) conversion
Below script is used to convert FP32 model to ONNX model representation. By default, the converted onnx model file will be saved in
openvino/openvino_models/openvino_onnx.

```
usage: convert_to_onnx.py [-h] [-o OUTPATH] [-w WEIGHTS] [-mname MODEL_NAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPATH, --outpath OUTPATH
                        absolute path to save converted model. By default it will be saved in "./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_onnx" folder
  -w WEIGHTS, --weights WEIGHTS
                        Model Weights in ".pt" format
  -mname MODEL_NAME, --model_name MODEL_NAME
                        Name of the model to be created in ".onnx" format, default "TrafficOD"
```

<b>Example</b>
```sh
python openvino/convert_to_onnx.py
```
The converted model will be saved to the openvino/openvino_models/openvino_onnx in .onnx format.

Below command is used to convert the onnx model to OpenVINO IR model format.
```sh
mo --input_model <onnx model> --output_dir <output dir path to save the IR model>
```
Arguments
```
--input_model     onnx model
--output_dir      path of the folder to save the OpenVINO IR model format
```
The above command will generate `<model-name>.bin` and `<model-name>.xml` as output which can be used for OpenVINO inference. Default precision is FP32.

<b>Example</b>
```sh
mo --input_model ./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_onnx/TrafficOD_Onnx_Model.onnx --output_dir ./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_ir
```

#### Model Performance with OpenVINO Post-Training Optimization Tool
Post-training Optimization Tool (POT) is designed to accelerate the inference of deep learning models by applying special methods without model 
retraining or fine-tuning. One such method is post-training quantization.

Below command is used to run the benchmark tool for the ONNX model generated. 

```sh
benchmark_app -m <path of onnx model>
```

Argument
```
-m,--modelpath   path of model in onnx format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_onnx/TrafficOD_Onnx_Model.onnx -api async -niter 120 -nireq 1 -b 1 -nstreams 1 -nthreads 8 -hint none
```

Below command is used to run the benchmark tool for the OpenVINO IR model. 
```sh
benchmark_app -m <Path of the OpenVINO IR modell in xml format>
```
Argument
```
-m,--modelpath   Path of model in OpenVINO IR model in xml format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_ir/TrafficOD_Onnx_Model.xml -api async -niter 120 -nireq 1 -b 1 -nstreams 1 -nthreads 8 -hint none
```
#### Model Conversion Using OpenVino Quantization
Below script is used to convert OpenVINO IR model to OpenVINO INT8 model representation. By default, the converted OpenVINO INT8 model will be saved in
openvino/openvino_models/openvino_quantized.

```
usage: openvino_quantization.py [-h] [-m FPIR_MODELPATH] [-o OUTPATH] [-d DATA_YAML] [-b BATCHSIZE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m FPIR_MODELPATH, --FPIR_modelpath FPIR_MODELPATH
                        FP32 IR Model absolute path without extension
  -o OUTPATH, --outpath OUTPATH
                        default output quantized model will be save in path specified by outpath
  -d DATA_YAML, --data_yaml DATA_YAML
                        Absolute path to the yaml file containing paths data/ download data
  -b BATCHSIZE, --batchsize BATCHSIZE
                        batch size used for loading the data
```

<b>Example</b>
```sh
python openvino/openvino_quantization.py
```
After running the above command, we can verify that "<model-name>.bin", "<model-name>.xml", "<model-name>.mapping" files (quantized model) got generated on "openvino/openvino_models/openvino_quantized" path.

Note> At the end Users can also observe the evaluation score of OpenVINO IR FP32 model as well as OpenVINO INT8 model.

##### Model Performance Using Quantized (INT8) Model
Use the below command to run the benchmark tool for the Quantized OpenVINO IR model.

```sh
benchmark_app -m <quantized POT model in xml format>
```

Argument
```
-m,--quantizedmodelpath   Quantized POT model in xml format
```
<b>Example</b>
```sh
benchmark_app -m ./openvino/openvino_models/openvino_quantized/torch_jit.xml -api async -niter 120 -nireq 1 -b 1 -nstreams 1 -nthreads 8 -hint none
